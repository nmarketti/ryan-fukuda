				<p class="intro-text">I have an affinity for creating ideas and making them come to life. I spent my college years studying Video Technology, Film Producing & Writing learning the ends and outs of how to run a production from idea to exhibition. Over the years, I've worked in event coordinating and collaborated with other professionals & small businesses to create videos and short films. Currently, I'm committed to supporting communities I'm apart of and share our stories across all different types of mediums for various types of audiences. Occult Generation, a comic book series, is the first of many projects that emanate this ambitious commitment.</p>

				<p class="intro-text">I took my first meditation class after my 8th grade graduation. Like most of you, I was quite empathic growing up and was lucky to have an outlet where I could learn how to validate my awareness and manage life's unexpected curve balls. Having over 17 years of training at psychic schools and professional experiences, I joyfully play in the game of life as a highly-aware creative, practitioner and teacher. Currently, I'm established in the San Francisco Bay Area continuing my education and practice along with building community awareness surrounding energy and the psychic lifestyle. I also teach psychic classes and workshops online via webcam with Portland Psychic School and in-person in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

It is a means to find a clear, neutral perspective to the questions you are asking yourself on a daily basis about life purpose, health, work, love, and so much more. The purpose of a psychic reading varies, but it can be seen as a means to acknowledge and explore the true essence of a person. </p>
